// There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

// input
// customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
// n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.
// output
// The function should return an integer, the total time required.

// Important
// Please look at the examples and clarifications below, to ensure you understand the task correctly :)

// Examples
// queueTime([5,3,4], 1)
// // should return 12
// // because when there is 1 till, the total time is just the sum of the times

// queueTime([10,2,3,3], 2)
// // should return 10
// // because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the 
// // queue finish before the 1st person has finished.

// queueTime([2,3,10], 2)
// // should return 12

// Unable to solve

function queueTime(customers, n) {
  
        // Make an array containing n amount of elements, 
        // n representing the number of tills, 
        // and fill with zeroes
        var tills = new Array(n).fill(0);
      
        // Iterate through the customers 
        for (let time of customers) {
      
          // Find the till that has the least time
          let idx = tills.indexOf(Math.min(...tills));
      
          // Add the time, representing the customer to
          // the till that has the least time
          tills[idx] += time;
        }
      
        // Return the till that has the longest wait time
        // This is the required time to get all customers
        // through the que.
        return Math.max(...tills);
      
  }


console.log(queueTime([1,2,3,4,5], 2))

// Best practice #2

function queueTime(customers, n) {
    let tills = Array(n).fill(0);
    
    customers.forEach((customer) => {
      let nextTill = tills.indexOf(Math.min(...tills))
      tills[nextTill] += customer;
    });
  
    return Math.max(...tills);
